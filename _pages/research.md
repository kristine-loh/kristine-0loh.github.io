## Academic Research Experience
**Ferry and Kortshagen Groups | Minneapolis, MN**<br/>
*Graduate Research Fellow | January 2021 to Present <br/>
Advisors: Drs. Vivian Ferry and Uwe Kortshagen* 
* Utilize non-thermal plasma to synthesize silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) for agrivoltaic applications
* Characterize SiNCs using quantum yield measurements, lifetime analysis, FTIR, and XRD
* Deposit homogenous silicon nitride thin films using rotating stage motor
* Simulate optical performance of luminescent solar concentrators using Monte Carlo ray-tracing MATLAB code

**Nanomaterials for Energy Applications and Technology (NEAT) Lab | Philadelphia, PA**<br/>
*Undergraduate Research Assistant | April 2017 to June 2020<br/>
Students Tackling Advanced Research (STAR) Scholar | June to August 2016<br/>
Advisor: Dr. Jason B. Baxter*
* Investigated mechanisms of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>_x_</sub> and Mo<sub>2</sub>TiC<sub>2</sub>T<sub>_x_</sub> film optoelectronic behavior in response to various stimuli through photoconductivity measurements
* Led research efforts on using Ti-doped hematite thin films synthesized using Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) as an enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitter
* Analyzed SbSI microrods as novel pathways for electron transport using UV-Vis, SEM, EDS, and XRD
* Synthesized CuSbS<sub>2</sub> thin films using chemical bath deposition
